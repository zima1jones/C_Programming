Hi 
This is my journey in learning C
I literally don't know why I'm doing this -  actually I do I'd like to combine my skills with this and python 
to not only make robots but also make informed decsions on cities - to not only help myself
but also the students that I will be teaching this too i'd like to have them prepared to 
battle the AI wave of the future and first you must be able to work with these computers so this will be my challenge
to learn C and Python to a great enough level that the students I teach will be equipped with skills to 
be able to carve out a life for themselves
